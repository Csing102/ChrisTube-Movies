## üîß How It Works

### TMDB API Integration

* The app uses the TMDB API to fetch trending movies and TV shows each week.
* In `loadItems()`, it constructs a URL with your `apiKey`, `currentType` (movie or tv), and `currentPage` parameters to retrieve JSON data.
* Movie and show details (title, poster path, seasons) are parsed and passed to `createCard()` for rendering.
* Search suggestions leverage the TMDB `search/multi` endpoint for type-ahead results.

### Video Embedding via Vidsrc

* When a user clicks a movie poster, `openModal()` injects an `<iframe>` pointing to Vidsrc‚Äôs embed URL:

  ```js
  container.innerHTML = `<iframe src="https://vidsrc.to/embed/movie/${id}" allowfullscreen sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-presentation"></iframe>`;
  ```
* For TV shows, `openModal()` first fetches show details (seasons) from TMDB, then constructs Vidsrc episode embeds dynamically as users select seasons/episodes.
